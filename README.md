# django-simple-captcha-cracker-poc

## Background
The audio challenges used by [django-simple-captcha](https://github.com/mbi/django-simple-captcha/tree/master/testproject) are generated by the [flite](http://www.festvox.org/flite/) program.

However, flite produces constant output for any given input.

So, for example, the command:

 $ flite -t "B, C, H, U" -o BCHU.wav

will produce the same output file every time it is run.

## The problem
By default, the challenges are only four letters long. This means that there
are only 26^4 = 456976 different possible audio files which can be used for
captcha challenges. It follows that it is possible to generate all possible
challenges and store them in a database to lookup later. Then, when presented
with a challenge, we can simply look it up in the database to find the solution.
(For size reasons, we have decided to use hashes instead of storing all of
the files.)

## The solution
So that this type of attack is not possible, ideally action should be taken to
ensure that one solution can be represented by many different audio challenges.
It may be possible to do this using different voice files, randomly varying
speed and pitch, or adding random sounds in between letters (though care must
be taken such that whatever operation taken is difficult to reverse).

Until this is done, a more temporary solution may be to increase the length of
challenges offered to your users. You should not disable audio challenges
altogether, since this will mean that users with vision problems will not be
able to use your website.

## Limitations
It is possible that flite produces different output depending on software
versions or operating system, and it definitely produces different output if
a different voice from the default is selected. To get around this, an attacker
would need to determine the flite setup of the target server, though this would
be possible by simply analysing examples of received challenges and trying to
generate a match.

## How to use this Proof of Concept tool

1. Install dependencies. Note that this tool uses Python 2, not Python 3.
Using pip:
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
Using apt (on Debian-based systems):
 $ apt install python-bs4

2. Run the testproject created by the developers:
 $ git clone https://github.com/mbi/django-simple-captcha
 $ cd django-simple-captcha/testproject
 $ python manage.py runserver
If all has gone well, then the server should be running on
http://localhost:8000
If this is not the case, you will need to modify the argument to the
getCaptcha() function in captcha_cracker.py before running it.

3. Run the script! It should download a challenge from the server, and print
the solution to the terminal.
 $ python captcha_craker.py

4. If this does not work, you may have a different flite setup to the 
one I had when I generated the database, and you will have to generate your own.
This can take a long time, so be patient, and do not interrupt it while it is
running. To do this, you must:

4.1. Remove the non-working database
 $ rm checksums.db

4.2. Uncomment genDatabase() in captcha_cracker.py. That is, replace the line:
#genDatabase()
with
genDatabase()

4.3. Run the modified script!
 $ python captcha_cracker.py
